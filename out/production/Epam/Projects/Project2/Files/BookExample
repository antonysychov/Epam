Exceptions

WHEN a program violates the semantic constraints of the Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine signals this error to the program as an exception. An example of such a violation is an attempt to index outside the bounds of an array. Some programming languages and their implementations react to such errors by peremptorily terminating the program; other programming languages allow an implementation to react in an arbitrary or unpredictable way. Neither of these approaches is compatible with the design goals of the Java SE platform: to provide portability and robustness. 

Instead, the Java programming language specifies that an exception will be thrown when semantic constraints are violated and will cause a non-local transfer of control from the point where the exception occurred to a point that can be specified by the programmer. 
An exception is said to be thrown from the point where it occurred and is said to be caught at the point to which control is transferred.
